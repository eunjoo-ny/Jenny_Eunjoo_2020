I would like to learn works or jobs in terms of building human relationships based on not only mathematics,
and data-science but also making programs by python, C, java. I believe that the mathematics and statistics
fields reap the benefit when it is connected with other people and programming language based on mathematics
will realize my ideal and thought which, occurs through human relationships. In the master course, I will go 
the extra mile to have the professional ability and through the internship, I want to make a good relationship
with other people involved in other areas and communicate. Later, I would like to apply programming language
based on mathematics and these cooperations to the area, which everybody wishes and dreams.
